CS 143: Project 1B - README

TEAM: Leslie Liang, Brian Be

Project Description
============================
We believe we have met all of the specifications on the spec. Notably, we were able
to perform the 6 cases stated in the spec. We were able to search to "Tom Hanks"
and have the web page show the correct contents. The remaining 5 cases
on the website also worked flawlessly.

The website is not very flowery but it gets the job done. We are able to
perform the basic functionality of a movie database website. The website
is easy to navigate with a convenient search bar on the left side of the
website for easy searching.


Team work
---------------------------
Leslie worked on the 5 input pages (I1, I2, I3, I4, I5). He worked on
the page which lets the users add information about an actor/direction. He
also let users add movie information. He worked on the page that lets users
add comments to the movie. Finally, the last two pages that he worked on
are the "actor to movie" and "director to movie" relation.

Brian was the mastermind in bringing everything together. He mainly worked on
Pages B1 and B2. He also worked on incorporating all of Leslie's 5 pages
as a single entity (by providing hyperlinks). Brian worked on the
hyperlinks on the left side of the web page which were web pages
created by Leslie. Brian worked on a page that shows actor information and
he also worked on a page that shows movie information.

Team Environment Feedbacks
---------------------------
We believe that one aspect we feel we can improve in a team setting for
better collaboration is being able to manage our time better. However, because
we both had midterms and homework due during that week, it was hard for us
to work on the project and study for upcoming midterms. Brian had a hard
time working on his search pages without Leslie finishing his input pages
because his search pages relied on Leslie's input pages. This was because
Leslie had other homework and midterms that were due earlier than CS 143
Project 1B.

Besides that, Brian and Leslie believe that they worked pretty well as a team.
They split their workload evenly and fairly and they work together to
solve problems and learn from one another.
